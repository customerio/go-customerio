# Changelog

## July 6, 2021 v3.0.0
### Changed
- `trackAnonymous` now requires an `anonymous_id` parameter and will no longer trigger campaigns. If you previously used anonymous events to trigger campaigns, you can still do so [directly through the API](https://customer.io/docs/api/#operation/trackAnonymous). We now refer to anonymous events that trigger campaigns as ["invite events"](https://customer.io/docs/anonymous-events/#anonymous-or-invite).
